## Introduction to Probabilities

Using the same environment that you created last week, let's install more pakcapackages, namely pandas, statsmodels and scipy

```bash
source activate stats
conda install pandas scipy statsmodels

```

Now we can start working through the probability notebooks.

To run them as a slideshow, run the following command

```
ipython nbconvert week2.hypothesis-testing.ipynb --to slides --post serve

```

week2.md
week2.hypothesis-testing.ipynb
